# PubMed-Research-Filter
This project automates the extraction of research papers from PubMed, specifically filtering out non-academic authors and company-affiliated researchers. The script retrieves metadata such as the title, publication date, author names, affiliations, and corresponding author email and exports the results to a CSV file.
